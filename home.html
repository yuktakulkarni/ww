        A <i><b>Cryptocurrency</b></i> is a digital currency, which is an
        alternative form of payment created using encryption algorithms. The use
        of encryption technologies means that cryptocurrencies function both as
        a currency and as a virtual accounting system. It is a decentralized system for verifying that the parties to a transaction have the money they claim to have, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries, such as banks, when funds are being transferred between two entities.
	  Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger, which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. Despite their name, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense and
		 while varying treatments have been applied to them, including classification as commodities, securities, as well as currencies, cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice. 
		Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. 
		Generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other such reward mechanisms.
